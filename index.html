        <p>Mount Melbourne is a 2,733-metre-high (8,967 ft) ice-covered stratovolcano in Victoria Land, Antarctica. It
            is an
            elongated mountain with a snow-filled summit caldera and numerous parasitic vents; a volcanic field
            surrounds
            the
            edifice. Mount Melbourne has a volume of about 180 cubic kilometres (43 cu mi) and last erupted between 1862
            and
            1922.
            Its volcanism is related both to the West Antarctic Rift and to local tectonic structures such as faults and
            grabens.
            Mount Melbourne has mainly erupted trachyandesite and trachyte, which formed within a magma chamber;
            basaltic
            rocks are
            less common. Geothermal heat flow on Mount Melbourne has created an unusual ecosystem formed by mosses and
            liverworts
            that grow between fumaroles, ice towers, and ice hummocks. This type of vegetation is found at other
            volcanoes
            of
            Antarctica and develops when volcanic heat generates meltwater from snow and ice, thus allowing plants to
            grow
            in the
            cold Antarctic environment. (Full article...)
